# WebMux Frontend Performance Optimizations

## Summary
This document outlines the performance optimizations applied to the WebMux frontend codebase.

## Optimizations Completed

### 1. Bundle Size Reduction
- **Removed unused dependencies**: Eliminated `axios` (80 packages removed)
- **Removed unused components**: Deleted AudioControl component and related audio services
- **Result**: Bundle size reduced from 456KB to 436KB (4.4% reduction)

### 2. Terminal Performance Improvements
- **Optimized output buffering**: 
  - Implemented proper requestAnimationFrame batching with throttling
  - Added flow control to prevent buffer overflow
  - Reduced scrollback buffer from 10,000 to 5,000 lines
- **Used shallowRef**: Converted terminal and fitAddon to shallowRef to avoid deep reactivity
- **Improved resize handling**: Increased debounce from 100ms to 200ms

### 3. TypeScript Improvements
- **Eliminated 'any' types**: Replaced all instances with proper types or 'unknown'
- **Improved type safety**: Added proper types for WebSocket messages and error handling
- **Better generic constraints**: Fixed type issues in message handlers

### 4. Search & Stats Optimization
- **Debounced search**: Added 150ms debounce to search input
- **Reduced stats updates**: System stats now update every 5 seconds instead of every second
- **Optimized clock updates**: Separated clock updates (1s) from stats updates (5s)

### 5. Vue 3 Reactivity Optimizations
- **Added v-memo**: Applied to SessionList, WindowList, and search results
- **Used shallowRef**: Applied to terminal instance and fitAddon
- **Optimized computed properties**: Added debounced search query

## Performance Improvements

### Before Optimizations
- Bundle size: 456KB
- Terminal freezing with large outputs
- Stats updating every second
- No search debouncing
- Deep reactivity on terminal objects

### After Optimizations
- Bundle size: 436KB (-20KB, 4.4% reduction)
- Smooth terminal rendering with flow control
- Stats update every 5 seconds (80% reduction in API calls)
- 150ms search debounce
- Shallow reactivity for better performance

## Remaining Optimization Opportunities

1. **Lazy loading modals**: Convert create/delete modals to dynamic imports
2. **WebSocket batching**: Implement message queuing for multiple small messages
3. **Modal consolidation**: Extract common modal code into reusable component
4. **Virtual scrolling**: Implement for very large terminal outputs
5. **Binary protocol**: Consider protobuf for high-frequency terminal data

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test terminal performance with tools that produce large outputs (e.g., Claude Code)
2. Verify search functionality works smoothly with debouncing
3. Ensure all TypeScript types are properly validated
4. Check that removed components don't break any functionality
5. Test on mobile devices to ensure performance improvements are noticeable
